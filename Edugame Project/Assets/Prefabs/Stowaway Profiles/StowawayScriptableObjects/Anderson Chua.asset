  poorResult: Anderson Chua loved space fast food and carbonated drinks so much that
    he forgot about changing his lifestyle. Upon eating fast food one day, he gets
    a heart attack and is immediately sent to the medbay for treatment. He is now
    unable to drink Martian cow milk.
  adequateResult: "Anderson Chua still prefers eating fast food over healthy food,
    and only exercises once a week. He feels that he is not getting better, but he\u2019s
    not feeling worse either. He still wants to try that Martian cow milk."
  excellentResult: "Anderson Chua maintains a healthy lifestyle, exercises regularly,
    and eats more healthy foods now. He can now make a healthy smoothie with the
    Martian cow milk that he\u2019s going to get soon."
