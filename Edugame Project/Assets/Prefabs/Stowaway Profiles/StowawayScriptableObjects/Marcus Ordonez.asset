  poorResult: Marcus Ordonez was immediately sent to the Medbay after experiencing
    intense chest pain specifically around the heart area. He is now currently undergoing
    medication to prevent a possible heart attack.
  adequateResult: Marcus Ordonez continues to feel episodes of chest pain throughout
    the day. He thinks that perhaps he can also use these chest pains as an excuse
    to not write his paper.
  excellentResult: Marcus Ordonez noticed that the chest pains happen less frequently
    after getting medications and enough rest. He still does not want to write his
    paper but at least he feels better.
